# patient_controlled_anesthesia

This project's goal was to build a system on a Raspberry Pi to provide visual and audio stimuli to patients. This stimuli, as shown by research, would help reduce the patient's dependence on pain relieving drugs. 

The program runs as such that when the patient controlled analgesia device button is pressed, it sends a signal to the Raspberry Pi which starts the stimulus. The video played can be exchanged for something more personal to the patient. 

This project was funded and supported by University of California, San Francisco.
